# Interactive_Webmap

This program is coded in Python and uses the Folium library to render an interactive world map with popups showing volcano locations in USA and color-coded countries based on population.

Pandas was used to create data frames that read data from CSV and JSON files, and provided this data to Folium which used feature groups to display it on a Leaflet map.
